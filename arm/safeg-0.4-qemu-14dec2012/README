----------------------

2012 (c) Daniel Sangorrin <daniel.sangorrin@gmail.com>

This is a special package for testing SafeG on the QEMU emulator.
Please, refer to ./safeg/target/vexpress-a9/README-EN.txt for detailed instructions.

A set of scripts have been prepared for automatizing the process
of downloading the necessary sources, patching them and building them:

./prepare_env.sh
./fetch_sources.sh
./build_all.sh
./run_qemu.sh

When QEMU appears, press Ctrl+Alt+5 and U-Boot's prompt will appear.
Execute the following command to load and run SafeG, FMP and Linux
and use Ctrl+Alt+4,5 to see the output messages:

u-boot # run loadsafeg

Notice that these scripts may fail if your environment does not contain
certain applications. In particular, your environment should satisfy
requirements written at ./safeg/target/vexpress-a9/README-EN.txt,
such as having an specific ARM cross-compiler. Please understand 
the scripts before using them.
